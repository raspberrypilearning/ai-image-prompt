## What you will make

![A fluffy white cat with striking blue eyes and a pink nose sits across a windowsill and the back of a sofa, next to a potted plant in a decorative metal container. The windowsill is part of a cozy interior, with a floral cushion, a trailing green plant, and shelves. Through the window, a building is visible. In the foreground of the image, there is text that reads "HOME Hweet SWEET Home" in an elegant style, with some decoration.](images/prompt8.jpg)

Welcome to the exciting world of AI image generation!

By following the steps in this project, you will learn how to create amazing images using an AI image generator.

## title: More detail

This project will help you start with simple ideas and turn them into detailed prompts that you can use to produce stunning images. You will explore how to add specific details; describe settings; include key elements; and think about colours, styles, and composition. Along the way, you will test your prompts, make adjustments, and see how each change helps you create your image.

### What you will need

For this project, you will need access to an AI image generator.

If you are under the minimum age limits to use AI image generators that are available online, or if you would prefer to host **your own** AI image generator on a Raspberry Pi computer, [follow our instructions here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/ai-images-on-pi){:target="_blank"}.

#### Free Online Image Generators

A free image generator that does not require you to register is [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com){:target="_blank"}, but you must be the [age of majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority){:target="_blank"} in your jurisdiction, or older, to use it ([see the terms](https://www.craiyon.com/terms){:target="_blank"} for more information).

Other online tools are available, but require you to register with a current email address. Some examples include:

- [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/){:target="_blank"} (minimum age of 13, and if you are not of legal age to enter into the terms, you need permission from a parent/guardian to do so — [see the terms](https://www.adobe.com/uk/legal/terms.html){:target="_blank"} for more information)
- [Ideogram](https://www.ideogram.ai){:target="_blank"} (minimum age of 13, and if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, a parent/guardian must accept the terms on your behalf — [see the terms](https://ideogram.ai/legal/tos){:target="_blank"} for more information)
- [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/){:target="_blank"} ([see the terms](https://stablediffusionweb.com/terms-and-conditions){:target="_blank"})

## title:  Why do we recommend older learners use this project?

It's important to understand how you can keep your personal information safe. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is very careful about protecting your data and your privacy, which is why we only recommend this project if you're over 13 years old.

You might have noticed that many online services ask users to be at least 13 years old. This is because they handle and store data you provide, which can include personal information. Although these services follow strict rules to protect your data, sending information over the internet can sometimes be less secure.

It's also important to know that generative AI can sometimes create **content that isn’t accurate, fair, or appropriate**. These AI models can sometimes "hallucinate" and **produce information that sounds true but isn’t**. So, it’s important to **think carefully about the AI application’s output and double-check it**. As you work with generative AI, make sure to check the information and ask trusted sources if you’re unsure.

**Always look at AI-generated content with a careful and thoughtful mind.** If you need help, please ask a parent, guardian, or teacher to guide you.

Enjoy learning and creating with generative AI!
