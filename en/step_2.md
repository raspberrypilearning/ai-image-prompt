Begin with a basic idea. This is your starting point.
- Example: "A cat."

Run this prompt in the image generator. See what it creates.

**Add Specific Details**

Think about the details. What kind of cat? What is it doing?
- Example: "A **fluffy white** cat **sitting on a windowsill**."

Run this new prompt and compare it to the first image. How has it changed?

**Describe the background**

Where is the scene happening? Adding a setting makes your prompt more vivid.
- Example: "A fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill **in a cozy living room.**"

Run the prompt again. Notice the new elements that appear.

**Include Key Elements**

What other things should be in the scene?

**Specify Colors and Styles**

Colors and styles add character to your image. What mood or style do you want?
- Example: "A fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill with a **green** potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room."

Run the prompt. See how the colors and style affect the image.

**Think About Composition**

How should the image be composed? Is it a close-up or a wide shot?
- Example: "**A close-up of** a fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill with a green potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room."

Run the prompt and see how changing the composition changes the focus of the image.

**Add Text if Needed**

If you want text in the image, say what it should say and how it should look.
- Example: "A close-up of a fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill with a green potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room, **with the text 'Home Sweet Home' in cursive font at the bottom.**"

Run the prompt. Check if the text appears as you wanted and fits well with the image.

Outside, the view shows a building with multiple windows. In the foreground, there is text that reads "SUSCET Home sweet Home" in an elegant script, accompanied by decorative flourishes.

**Change and Refine**

Test your prompt with the image generator. If itâ€™s not perfect, tweak the details and try again. Throughout the previous images, you may have noticed the cat's eyes changing colour. Let's fix that now. 
- Example: "A close-up of a fluffy white cat **with blue eyes** sitting on a windowsill with a green potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room, with the text 'Home Sweet Home' in cursive font at the bottom."

Run the final prompt. Make any necessary changes until the image matches your vision.
