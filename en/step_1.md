### You will need:
Before you begin, you'll need access to an image generator. 

If you are under the required age limits or prefer to host *your own* AI image generator on a Raspberry Pi, [follow our instructions here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/ai-images-on-pi){:target="_blank"}.

A free image generator with no sign-up required is available at [Craiyon.com](https://www.craiyon.com){:target="_blank"}, but requires you to be the [age of majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority){:target="_blank"} in your country or older.

Other online tools are available, but require registration with a current email address. Some examples include:
- [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [Ideogram](https://www.ideogram.ai){:target="_blank"}
- [ChatGPT](https://www.chat.openai.org){:target="_blank"}
