Welcome to the exciting world of AI image generation! 

By following the steps in this project, you will learn how to create amazing images using an AI image generator.

This project will help you start with simple ideas and turn them into detailed prompts that you can use to produce stunning images. You will explore how to add specific details; describe settings; include key elements; and think about colours, styles, and composition. Along the way, you will test your prompts, make adjustments, and see how each change helps you create your image.

### What you will need

For this project, you will need access to an AI image generator.

If you are under the minimum age limits to use AI image generators that are available online, or if you would prefer to host **your own** AI image generator on a Raspberry Pi computer, [follow our instructions here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/ai-images-on-pi){:target="_blank"}.

A free image generator that does not require you to register is [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com){:target="_blank"}, but you must be the [age of majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority){:target="_blank"} in your jurisdiction, or older, to use it ([see the terms](https://www.craiyon.com/terms){:target="_blank"} for more information).

Other online tools are available, but require you to register with a current email address. Some examples include:
- [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/){:target="_blank"} (minimum age of 13, and if you are not of legal age to enter into the terms, you need permission from a parent/guardian to do so — [see the terms](https://www.adobe.com/uk/legal/terms.html){:target="_blank"} for more information)
- [Ideogram](https://www.ideogram.ai){:target="_blank"} (minimum age of 13, and if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, a parent/guardian must accept the terms on your behalf — [see the terms](https://ideogram.ai/legal/tos){:target="_blank"} for more information)
- [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/){:target="_blank"} ([see the terms](https://stablediffusionweb.com/terms-and-conditions){:target="_blank"})

**If you sign up for an account with one of these services, please remember to follow their safety policies.**


[Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com){:target="_blank"} is an open-source tool that allows you to generate high-quality images using AI, directly on your Raspberry Pi.

By following these steps, you'll turn your Raspberry Pi into a creative AI powerhouse using Stable Diffusion. You'll install the Stable Diffusion software along with its user-friendly interface, load a suitable AI model, and use it to create stunning images based on text prompts.

This setup will allow you to explore and experiment with advanced generative AI techniques, all from the convenience of your Raspberry Pi, empowering you to create unique visual content without needing to rely on online services.

### You will need:
- A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with a micro SD card of **at least** 32Gb storage.
- Access to an internet connection for the Raspberry Pi.

title:  Why do we recommend older learners use this resource?
---

If you're under 13 years old, it's important to understand how to keep your personal information safe. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is very careful about protecting your data and your privacy.

When you use generative AI projects on a Raspberry Pi, all of the work happens right on your device. **Your personal data stays on your computer and never leaves it.** This keeps your information safe and secure.

You might have noticed that many online services ask users to be at least 13 years old. This is because they handle and store data you provide, which can include personal information. Although these services follow strict rules to protect your data, sending information over the internet can sometimes be less secure.

**With the Raspberry Pi, everything stays on your own device,** so you don’t have to worry about your data being sent elsewhere. This lets you explore and learn about AI safely. If you need help, please ask a parent, guardian, or teacher to guide you.

It's also important to know that generative AI can sometimes create **content that isn’t accurate, fair, or appropriate**. These AI models can sometimes "hallucinate" and **produce information that sounds true but isn’t.** So, it’s important to **think carefully about the AI’s output and double-check it**. As you work with generative AI, make sure to check the information and ask trusted sources if you’re unsure.

**Always look at AI-generated content with a careful and thoughtful mind.**

Enjoy learning and creating with Generative AI!
