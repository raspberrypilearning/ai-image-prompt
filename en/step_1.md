This project will help you start with simple ideas and turn them into detailed prompts that you can use to produce stunning images. You will explore how to add specific details; describe settings; include key elements; and think about colours, styles, and composition. Along the way, you will test your prompts, make adjustments, and see how each change helps you create your image.
