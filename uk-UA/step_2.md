Run this prompt in the image generator. See what it produces.

**Add specific details**

Think about the details. What kind of cat? What is it doing?

Example: "A **fluffy white** cat **sitting on a windowsill**."

Run this new prompt and compare it to the first image. How has it changed?

**Describe the background**

Where is the scene happening? Adding a setting makes your prompt more descriptive for the model, giving details to go around the object of the image.

Example: "A fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill **in a cozy living room**."

Run the updated prompt. Notice the new elements that appear.

Run the prompt. See how the colours and style affect the image.

**Think about composition**

How should the image be composed? Is it a close-up or a wide shot?

Example: "**A close-up of** a fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill with a green potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room."

Run the prompt and see how changing the composition changes the focus of the image.

**Add text if you like**

If you want text in the image, include what it should say and how it should look.

Example: "A close-up of a fluffy white cat sitting on a windowsill with a green potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room, **with the text 'Home Sweet Home' in cursive font at the bottom**."

Run the prompt. Check if the text appears as you wanted and fits well with the image.

The windowsill is decorated with potted plants, including a succulent in a green pot. Through the window, there is a view of a building with multiple windows.

**Change and refine**

Test your prompt with the image generator. If it is not perfect, adjust the details and try again. Throughout the previous images, you may have noticed the cat's eyes changing colour. You could fix that now.

Example: "A close-up of a fluffy white cat **with blue eyes** sitting on a windowsill with a green potted plant next to it, in a cozy, vintage-style living room, with the text 'Home Sweet Home' in cursive font at the bottom."

Run the updated prompt. Make any necessary changes until the image matches your idea.

![A fluffy white cat with striking blue eyes and a pink nose sits across a windowsill and the back of a sofa, next to a potted plant in a decorative metal container. The windowsill is part of a cozy interior, with a floral cushion, a trailing green plant, and shelves. Through the window, a building is visible. In the foreground of the image, there is text that reads "HOME Hweet SWEET Home" in an elegant style, with some decoration.](images/prompt8.jpg)
